As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.\r\n- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.\r\n\r\n"

See `man git-cherry-pick` for details.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: There are two versions of this question so far.
